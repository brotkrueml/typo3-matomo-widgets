The recommended way to install this extension is by using Composer. In your
Composer-based TYPO3 project root, just type:

   composer req brotkrueml/typo3-matomo-widgets

and the recent version will be installed.

In a legacy installation you can also install the extension from the
`TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER)`_.

The extension offers some configuration which is explained in the
